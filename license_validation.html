    <h2>Digital License Validation</h2>
    <p>Digital License validation is the process of confirming that a specific license is current,
    authentic, and relevant.  Because GS1 Licenses are issued in a federated manor, license
    validation requires examing the set (chain) of licenses back to the GO root of trust.</p>
    <section id="license-validation-philosophy">
        <h3>Philosophy of License Validation</h3>
        <p>Digital license validation is the process by which a machine can verify that a license is
        authentic as part of the GS1 identity system. Generally, this involves validating the chain
        of licenses starting with the most specific license up to the root license
        issued by GS1 GO. In addition to checking the fields of the license documents, the documents must
        link together using the <code>extendsCredential</code> property forming a chain back to the root license.
        This chain must have properties so that each <code>licenseValue</code> stems from its previous <code>licenseValue</code>.
        This validation process is presented in detail in the sections below.</p>
        <p> For example, in the chain with prefix license 02, GCP 022345 and individual GTIN 02234545645654,
        we can see the <code>licenseValue</code> of the GTIN starts with the <code>licenseValue</code> of the GCP which starts with
        the <code>licenseValue</code> from the prefix license, indicating a complete and valid chain</p>

        <p><span class="todo">confirm with Steering Committee</span> What do we say here about the utility of validataing a license?  Should we 
        talk about whether this can be used with a presentation to validate a traading partners identity?</p>

        <h3>License Validation Rules</h3>
        <p>The following section contains rules for validation of GS1 Licenses.</p>

        These steps must be performed on all GS1 license credentials:

        <ul>
            <li>The credential document must be a valid VCDM 2.0 credential document (<span class="todo">TODO</span> is there a schema)</li>
            <li>The signature must be valid and from a signing key referenced in the issuer DID</li>
            <li>The credential must NOT be revoked (see <span class="todo">TODO</span>)</li>
            <li>The credential <code>validFrom</code> must not be in the future</li>
