        <h3>Philosophy of License Validation</h3>
        <p>Digital license validation is the process by which a machine can verify that a license is
        authentic as part of the GS1 identity system. Generally, this involves validating the chain
        of licenses starting with the most specific license up to the root license
        issued by GS1 GO. In addition to checking the fields of the documents, the documents must
        link together using the extendsCredential property forming a chain back to the root license.
        This chain must have properties so that each licenseValue stems from its previous license value.
        This validation process is presented in detail in the sections below.</p>
        <p> For example, in the chain with prefix license 02, GCP 022345 and individual GTIN 02234545645654,
        we can see the license value of the GTIN starts with the license value of the GCP which starts with
        the license value from the prefix license, indicating a complete and valid chain</p>
