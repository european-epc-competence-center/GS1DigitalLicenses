<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
   This document describes the GS1 Digital License Ecosystem. GS1 and its country-based member organizations 
   (<abbr title="Member Organizations">MO</abbr>) form a federated system to issue unique identifiers to its 
   Member Companies (<abbr title="Member Company">MC</abbr>) for trade items and entities including, but not
   limited to, <abbr title="Global Location Number">GLN</abbr>, <abbr title="Global Trade Identification Number">GTIN</abbr>, 
   <abbr title="Global Returnable Asset Identifier">GRAI</abbr>, <abbr title="Serialized Shipping Container Code">SSCC</abbr>,
    and other GS1 ID keys.  As trade communications is increasingly digital,
   GS1 is extending their license system to provide digital licenses using <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> 
   Verifiable Credentials (<abbr title="Verifiable Credential">VC</abbr>).  These 
   digital licenses allow companies to prove authority over their GS1 ID keys and product data.
   This document is intended for Member Company <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> architects and developers 
   wishing to learn and use GS1 Digital Licenses to issue trusted GS1 ID keys and verifiable product data.
